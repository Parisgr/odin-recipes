        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the shrimp: Season the shrimp with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the seasoned shrimp and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sauté the vegetables: In the same skillet, add a little more olive oil if needed. Add the sliced bell pepper, chopped onion, and minced garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Alfredo sauce: Pour the chicken broth into the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Stir in the cooking cream and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Then, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until it melts and combines with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Combine the pasta and sauce: Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is coated evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little more chicken broth or cooking cream to reach the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve: Place the shrimp on top of the Alfredo pasta and garnish with some extra Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
