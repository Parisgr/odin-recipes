                <li>1 cup marinara sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup crumbled goat cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sliced black olives</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the pizza dough package or to 450°F (230°C) if using homemade dough.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spread the marinara sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce as the base layer of cheese.</li>
            <li>Scatter the crumbled goat cheese, sliced mushrooms, black olives, and sun-dried tomatoes evenly over the pizza.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the pizza and season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle the torn fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing. This will help the cheese set slightly and make it easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Serve your unique and cheesy pizza hot and enjoy the explosion of flavors!</li>  
        </ol>
        <p>This recipe combines the classic mozzarella cheese with the tanginess of goat cheese, along with the earthy mushrooms, briny black olives, and sun-dried tomatoes for a delightful twist. The fresh basil leaves add a burst of freshness, while the grated Parmesan cheese adds an extra layer of savory goodness.</p>
